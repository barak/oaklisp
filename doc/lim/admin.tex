\section{Getting a Copy}

are available at http://www\linebreak[0].\linebreak[0]cs\linebreak[0].\linebreak[0]unm\linebreak[0].\linebreak[0]edu\linebreak[0]/\linebreak[0]\texttt{\~}bap\linebreak[0]/\linebreak[0]oaklisp/

\section{Bugs}

The following are known serious problems and inadequacies of the
current implementation.  People are invited to work on remedying them.
None of these are fundamental; they're simply due to lack of either
effort or motivation.

\begin{itemize}
\item Floating point numbers are not supported.  Rationals can be
used to make up for this lack.

\item In contrast to the error handling system, which is Industrial
Strength, the debugger barely exists.

\item There is no foreign function interface for loading and calling
C routines from a running Oaklisp.

%% Removed because this has been tightened up so much that only someone
%% familiar with the internals would be able to cobble up something that
%% would cause a core dump when invoked, and that would take some work.
%
% \item Calling some non-operations dumps core rather than invoking the
% debugger.
\end{itemize}

Bug reports and enhancements should be sent to \texttt{bap@cs.unm.edu}

We appreciate enhancements (especially in the form of patch files),
bug fixes, and bug reports.  We are particularly grateful for porting
problem fixes.  In a bug report, please include the precise version of
Oaklisp, which is indicated by the date at the end of the tar file.
And please try to make sure that it's really a bug and not a feature,
and pretty please, if at all possible, find a \emph{very short} program
that manifests your bug.  In any case please be aware that we are
under no obligation to respond to bug reports in any way whatsoever.

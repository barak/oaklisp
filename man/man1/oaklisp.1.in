.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oaklisp
[ emulator-options ... [ \-\- oaklisp-options ... ]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Oaklisp
is an object-oriented dialect of Scheme.  This implementation is quite
portable, compiling to a virtual machine which is emulated by a C
program.  Nevertheless, reasonable speed is achieved through a variety
of sophisticated techniques.

.SH OPTIONS
Options are all long, and it makes no difference if you start them
with one or two dashes (`-').  All options can be abbreviated to a
unique prefix.  There are two sorts of options: for the bytecode
emulator, and for the Oaklisp world.  You must use a -- to separate
them.

.SS EMULATOR OPTIONS

.TP

.SS OAKLISP OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-help
Show summary of Oaklisp options

.TP
.B \-\-eval expr
Evaluate Oaklisp expression, which is one arg so
be sure to quote for shell.

.TP
.B \-\-load file
Load a file.

.TP
.B \-\-compile file
Compile file.oak yielding file.oa

.TP
.B \-\-locale x
Switch to locale x, eg system-locale (default),
compiler-locale, scheme-locale (for RnRS
compatibility).

.TP
.B \-\-exit
Exit upon processing this option.

.SH EXAMPLES

This will compile the file myfile.oak in the scheme locale and then
leave the user in a read-eval-print loop in the scheme locale.

.B oaklisp \-\- \-\-locale scheme\-locale \-\-compile myfile

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable OAKWORLD will override the default compiled
into the executable, but itself can be overridden on the command line.

.SH FILES
@pkglibdir@/oakworld.bin holds the world image.  It is portable
between machines of the same endianity.  The location can vary
depending upon installation-time decisions.

.SH BUGS
Floating point numbers are not implemented.  Rationals can be used to
make up for this lack because rationals can be told to print in
floating point format and floating point format input can be made to
read as rational numbers.  (There are a couple floating point
implementations, but they are not merged into the distributed
release.)

In contrast to the error handling system, which is Industrial
Strength, the debugger is virtually nonexistent.

There is no foreign function interface for loading and calling C
routines from a running Oaklisp.  (Again, there are a couple
implementations of foreign function interfaces which are not merged
in.)

The memory format does not support uninterpreted "blobs".

Porting the system to 64-bit machines has not been done, and would be
quite difficult.

POSIX threads in the emulator never got quite finished.

.SH REFERENCES

The programs are documented more fully in the language and
implementation manuals included with the distribution.  In binary
packages these are probably in /usr/share/doc/oaklisp\-doc/lang.pdf and
lim.pdf.
